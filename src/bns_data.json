A, by\ntaking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to\nmisappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a\nplace where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking\nthe ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten.

Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s\nimplied consent to use Z’s book. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.\n(n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows\nto belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is authorised\nto give away alms. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.\n(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to\nbelong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If\nA takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes\nthat property out of Z’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not\ncommit theft.\n(2) Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description\nfor a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of second\nor subsequent conviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished with\nrigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend\nto five years and with fine:\nProvided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five\nthousand rupees, and a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the value\nof property or restoration of the stolen property, shall be punished with community service.\n80\nTHE ____________________________________________________________\nGAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINARY\n[Part II—\n____________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________\n___________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________\nSnatching."

A is guilty of forgery; and if B,\nknowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A’s intention, B is also guilty of\nforgery.\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same\nname. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was\nendorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B.
